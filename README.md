I'm building a small 8-bit computer from gates. It should be able to run essentially any program (just really inefficiently). The interface will likely consist of a bunch of LEDs for output and some sort of input system. There is also the possibility of having it interface with other kinds of devices.

Here's the plan:

1) Design and simulate the digital-logic portions of the computer (using Intel Quartus)

	a) arithmetic unit

	b) registers

	c) memory

	d) any required IO processing

2) Design the physical layout of the computer (using CAD/ECAD software)

	a) layout the main computer

	b) design IO layout

	c) perhaps create a PCB

	d) some sort of nice physical board for it all to go together

3) Build it!

4) ??? 

5) Profit?
